		- followed by a new line
	- You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statement
	- Your program should be maximum 5 lines long

6. Play with strings

	- Complete this [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/6-concat.py) to print `Welcome to Holberton School!`

	- You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/6-concat.py)
	- You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements.
	- You have to use the variables `str1` and `str2` in your new line of code
	- Your program should be exactly 5 lines long

7. Copy - Cut - Paste

	- [7-edges.py]: Complete this [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/7-edges.py)

	- You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/7-edges.py)
	- You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
	- Your program should be exactly 8 lines long
	- `word_first_3` should contain the first 3 letters of the variable `word`
	- `word_last_2` should contain the last 2 letters of the variable `word`
	- `middle_word` should contain the value of the variable `word` without the first and last letters.

8. Create a new sentence

8-concat_edges.py: Python script that prints object-oriented programming with Python, followed by a new line without creating new variables or string literals.
Completion of this source code.
9. Easter Egg

9-easter_egg.py: Python script that prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters, followed by a new line.
10. Linked list cycle

10-check_cycle.c: C function that checks if a linked list contains a cycle.
Returns 0 if there is no cycle and 1 if there is.
Helper files:
linked_lists.c: C functions handling linked lists for testing 10-check_cycle.c (provided by Holberton School).
lists.h: Header file containing definitions and prototypes for all types and functions used in linked_lists.c and 10-check_cycle.c.
11. Hello, write

100-write.py: Python script that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line to stderr using the function write from the sys module.
Exits with a status code of 1.
12. Compile

101-compile: Python script that compiles a Python script file stored in the environment variable $PYFILE and saves it to an output file $PYFILEc (ex. export PYFILE=my_main.py => output filename: my_main.pyc).
